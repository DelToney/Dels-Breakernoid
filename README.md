Week 1 of this project was fairly basic. A lot of what I known from my
internship in CO was pretty relevant to this project and helped me understand
a lot of the more complex concepts rather quickly.


The only thing I wished was that he would go more in depth with each of the
elements and explain how they work rather than just say "It works, just leave
it"


Total Time spent: 4 hours

Week 2 I had a lot of trouble programming the collision for the paddle and
getting each side to register as the correct side was a huge pain in the ass.
But after a bunch of tinkering and quintuple checking bounding boxes everything
works!

The blocks were a slight pain to get set up though.


Total Time: 4.5 hours

week 3 and 4: THE POWER UPS. I HATE THESE THINGS. And the fact that he didn't
teach us about bounding boxes earlier?! What?!


Well Now that i've expressed my anger, I like how this tutorial is being taught
because it showcases how easily mutable code is, which is SUPER KEY to learn
early, and I appreciate finally seeing it in action.


And getting Catch to work was a nightmare.


Total Time: 7 Hours

Weeks 5 and 6 Levels have not been as much of an issue because I learned XML at
my internship, so connecting that to C# isn't as hard as I expected. As well,
fixing the bounce wasn't that bad, so that didn't take up much time at all

Total Time: 4 Hours
